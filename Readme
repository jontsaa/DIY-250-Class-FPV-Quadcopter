# Custom 250-Class FPV Racing Drone

This repository documents the build, configuration of a custom-built 250-class FPV quadcopter. The project focuses on a durable carbon fiber frame design paired with reliable, high-performance components.

## 🚁 Project Overview

This drone is built on a ZMR250-style carbon fiber frame, designed for stability and durability. It utilizes EMAX cooling series motors and BLHeli-based ESCs for responsive throttle control. The power distribution is handled by Matek Systems components to ensure clean power delivery to sensitive electronics.
